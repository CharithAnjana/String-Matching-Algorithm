DSA - String Matching Algorithm

* In here c++ is used as the programing language for the implementation of the algorithm.

* To execute, this program needs two type of text files as inputs.
	1. Pattern file – in the pattern folder and contains the pattern (pattern1.txt, pattern3.txt…).
	2. Text file – in the text folder and contains the text (text1.txt, text2.txt...).

* After executing the program, the result will be written into a file in the 'output' folder.
* All the folders contain pattern, text, output and the source code must be in the same file directory. 

* Naïve string-matching algorithm is used to solve this problem. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m*n).
